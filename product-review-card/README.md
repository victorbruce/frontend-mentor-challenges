## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using the srcset and sizes attribute on an image tag.

```html
<img srcset="" sizes="" src="" alt="" />
```

### Continued development

I will like to look into how to handle images of different sizes for different screens using the srcset and sizes attributes instead of using css to change images based on the screen size. I had some few challenges using this attribute in this project.
